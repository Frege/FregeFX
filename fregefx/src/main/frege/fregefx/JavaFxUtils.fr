{--
    Unsafe, best-effort function for looking up a node in a scene.
    This returns a Node value on the Java side but in order to do
    anything sensible with this on the Frege side, we need a specialized subtype like @TextArea@.
    The function lookupNode returns such a specialized type by returning an instance of @IO CastTarget@.
    Errors are thrown at runtime if the selector String cannot be found or yields the wrong type.
    *Use only if you are ok with runtime errors!*
