## Release Notes

### Release 0.3.1

The first release to support the 3.24-7.x Frege compiler.
    
The API has been to a large extent commented out as it will change with upcoming changes to the
Frege compiler and native declarations where things will get dramatically simpler. 
Anyway, enough is left to support the 
[Frege Tutorial](https://github.com/Dierk/fregeTutorial)

All compilation targets Java 7 (even though you need to compile and run with Java 8).
The user of this library also needs to compile with the same setting, i.e.:

* use Java 8 for compiling and running
* set target=1.7 for both, the Java and Frege compiler
* use the 3.24-7.30 Frege compiler.
